# Programming Puzzles

This is a collection of puzzles I've solved on various sites over
the years. Or at least, as many as I could find.

Notably absent are everything I've done on leetcode, several
projecteuler solutions, and some of my earliest advent of code
solutions. 

Note that many of these are very old and therefore of poor quality. 
For my most recent work, check the 2021 advent of code. 

All of these were written in one pass with no outside help, so
they could probably use some editing but that's against the spirit
of archiving them here.
